# Creating a contract

This Solidity program is a simple "Token Creation" program. the purpose of this program is to demonstrate how tokens get minted and burned to a specific address.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has two functions namely: "mint" and "burn". the mint function is used to assign or add tokens to a specific address. On the other hand, the burn function is used to remove or deduct tokens to a specific address. The burn function also has a conditional that checks if the amount inside the address is greater than the amount to be burned, this is to make sure that the outcome won't result to a negative number.
